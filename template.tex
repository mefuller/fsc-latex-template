\section*{Introduction}
This is an unofficial abstract template for the annual FSC meeting.
It is used to apply for oral presentation.
The cover sheet for application to present is included as a separate (fillable) PDF.

\section*{Font, Layout, and Margins}
Abstracts should not exceed two pages including graphics.
Please keep the formatting as it is: font ``Arial'', font size 11, line spacing 1.08 cm.
In contrast to last year, we avoid a multi-stage procedure with a short abstract for this conference.
However, the abstracts will still be reviewed by the professors and then included in our book of abstracts.
In case of a poster, hand in a short summary.
Please assign your topic to one of the sessions contained in the drop-down menu.
You will be informed as soon as possible if your abstract has been accepted.

\section*{Page Numbers}
There are no page numbers.
The abstract is allowed a maximum of two pages.
A sample citation\cite{Affleck1967}.


\subsection*{Contents}
There are no required sections.
This is another citation\cite{Haworth2011}.

\section*{Illustrations}
The illustrations and their captions should be included within the manuscript at a location closest to the first reference describing them.
The labels, symbols and other information on the illustrations should be no smaller than 10 points.
Illustrations may be in color or black and white, but all non-illustration text (including captions) must be in black.
